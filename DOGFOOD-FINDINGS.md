# Dogfood Findings Log

Tracked findings from running eedom against itself during the `next` branch architecture refactoring. Each finding produces a deterministic regression test.

| D1 | OPA parse error on semgrep YAML | bug | OPA eval `-d ./policies` includes non-Rego files | `test_opa_ignores_non_rego_files` | **FIXED** (config.py → policy.rego) |
| D2 | Semgrep 2279 findings on self-scan | noise | Runs against entire repo | `test_semgrep_respects_file_scoping` | OPEN |
| D3 | Actionability: all code findings "blocked" | bug | No fixed_version → classified as blocked | `test_actionability_handles_code_findings` | OPEN |
| D4 | MI score 38/100 with 163 grade-C | info | Expected for subprocess-heavy plugins | KNOWN |
