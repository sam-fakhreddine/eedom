"""Deterministic guards for CLI multi-ecosystem support (#252).

These tests detect when the CLI dependency review behavior does not match
the claimed multi-ecosystem support. The CLI claims 18 ecosystem support
but the file discovery only looks for specific extensions, missing key
manifest files.

Bug: #252 — CLI dependency review behavior lags multi-ecosystem claims
