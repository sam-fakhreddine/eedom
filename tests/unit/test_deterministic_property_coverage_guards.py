"""Deterministic static guard for missing Hypothesis property tests (Issue #259).

Bug: The parsing modules for dependency diffs, PR hunk parsing, and manifest
     discovery are tested only with fixed example inputs.  Boundary invariants —
     such as "parsing never crashes on arbitrary UTF-8 input" or "empty inputs
     always return empty results" — are not captured by property-based tests.

Evidence:
  - tests/unit/test_diff.py         — no @given decorator
  - tests/unit/test_pr_review.py    — no @given decorator
  - tests/unit/test_manifest_discovery.py — no @given decorator

Fix: Add Hypothesis @given-decorated tests to each of the above files covering at
     least the SAFETY property "parser never raises on arbitrary string input" and
     the INVARIANT property "empty input returns empty output".

Parent bug: #225 / Epic: #146.
Status: xfail — @given not present in any of the three test files.
