"""Deterministic guards for plugin fail-open behaviour — Issue #245 / Parent #211.

Bug: sarif.py emits eedom-plugin-error results at level "error". sarif_to_review()
treats any SARIF error as a blocking finding (REQUEST_CHANGES), so a scanner
timeout or tool crash blocks a PR review exactly as if it were a security
violation — contradicting the fail-open invariant.

These are xfail until plugin errors are tagged separately and downgraded to
COMMENT behaviour. See issues #211 and #245.
