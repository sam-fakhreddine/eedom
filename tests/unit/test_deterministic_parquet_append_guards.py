"""Deterministic source-inspection guard for Parquet append efficiency (Issue #256).

Bug: append_decisions() reads the entire existing Parquet file before writing,
     performing an O(n) full-file rewrite every time any new decision is appended.

Evidence:
  - parquet_writer.py line 135: `existing = pq.read_table(parquet_path, schema=schema)`
  - parquet_writer.py line 136: `combined = pa.concat_tables([existing, new_table])`
  - parquet_writer.py line 140: `pq.write_table(combined, parquet_path)`

Fix: Use partitioned Parquet writes (one file per run), DuckDB COPY INTO APPEND,
     or a different file-per-run strategy so that appending new decisions never
     requires reading the accumulated history.

Parent bug: #222 / Epic: #146.
Status: xfail — read_table still present in append_decisions().
