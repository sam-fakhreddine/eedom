"""Deterministic source-inspection guard for SBOM audit trail gap (Issue #251).

Bug: evaluate_sbom() omits the two audit-trail calls that evaluate() makes:
  1. append_decisions() — Parquet audit log append
  2. create_seal() — tamper-evident evidence sealing

Evidence:
  - pipeline.py evaluate() lines 285-294: calls both append_decisions and create_seal
  - pipeline.py evaluate_sbom() finally block (line 476-477): only calls db.close()

These tests detect the gap by inspecting the source of evaluate_sbom() for the
required function call strings.  When the bug is fixed, both strings will appear
in the source and these tests will go green.

Status: xfail — bug still present in pipeline.py.
