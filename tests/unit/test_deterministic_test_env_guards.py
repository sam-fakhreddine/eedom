"""Regression guard for #203: make test bind mount hiding container-built uv environment.

Bug (FIXED): Dockerfile.test built the uv venv under /workspace, but make test
bind-mounted the host checkout over /workspace:ro, hiding the container-built
environment. Tests ran against host-visible state rather than the image-built
venv, breaking the deterministic container-only test standard.

Fix: UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/opt/test-venv anchors the venv outside /workspace.
The make test target invokes /opt/test-venv/bin/python directly without a bind mount.

These are regression guards — they PASS while the fix is in place and FAIL if
someone reverts the Dockerfile or Makefile back to the broken pattern.
See issues #203 and #237.
