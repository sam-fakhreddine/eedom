"""Deterministic source-inspection guard for PyPI client lifecycle (Issue #255).

Bug: ReviewPipeline.evaluate() creates a PyPIClient but never closes it.
     The finally block at pipeline.py lines 296-297 only calls db.close().
     Any connection pool or keep-alive session held by PyPIClient is leaked.

Evidence:
  - pipeline.py line 149: `pypi_client = d["PyPIClient"](timeout=config.pypi_timeout)`
  - pipeline.py lines 296-297: `finally: db.close()` — no pypi_client.close()

Fix: Add `pypi_client.close()` to the finally block of evaluate(), alongside
     the existing `db.close()` call.

Parent bug: #221 / Epic: #146.
Status: xfail — pypi_client.close() missing from the evaluate() finally block.
