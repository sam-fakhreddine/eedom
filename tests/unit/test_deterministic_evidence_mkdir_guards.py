"""Deterministic guards for EvidenceStore parent dir creation — Issue #242 / Parent #208.

Bug: FileEvidenceStore.store() creates the run-key directory (dest_dir) but does
not ensure the artifact's parent directory exists when artifact_name contains a
subdirectory (e.g. "requests/decision.json"). The atomic rename then fails with
FileNotFoundError because dest_dir/requests/ was never created.

These are xfail until store() calls final_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True,
exist_ok=True) before the rename. See issues #208 and #242.
