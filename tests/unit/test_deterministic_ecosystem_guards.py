"""Deterministic source-inspection guard for hardcoded ecosystem (Issue #252).

Bug: ReviewPipeline.evaluate() hardcodes ecosystem="pypi" when creating dependency
     change requests.  This means non-PyPI ecosystems (npm, cargo, maven, etc.)
     are evaluated with the wrong ecosystem label, producing incorrect OPA metadata
     and PyPI API lookups against the wrong registry.

Evidence:
  - pipeline.py line 111: ecosystem="pypi" — hardcoded string literal in the
    create_requests() call inside evaluate().

Fix: derive the ecosystem from the changed file's manifest type (requirements.txt →
     pypi, package.json → npm, Cargo.toml → cargo, etc.) via DependencyDiffDetector
     or a dedicated ecosystem resolver.

Status: xfail — hardcoded value still present in pipeline.py.
