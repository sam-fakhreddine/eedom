"""Deterministic guards for manifest detection vs parser coverage — Issue #244 / Parent #210.

Bug: diff.py detects setup.py, setup.cfg, Pipfile, Pipfile.lock, and poetry.lock
as dependency files that trigger a review. However, pipeline_helpers.parse_changes()
only handles requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt, and pyproject.toml. A changed
Pipfile or setup.py is detected, routes into the pipeline, then silently produces
no dependency review decision — the user sees no feedback.

These are xfail until either:
  (a) every detected manifest has a parser in parse_changes(), or
  (b) unsupported manifests are explicitly routed through the SBOM diff path.
See issues #210 and #244.
