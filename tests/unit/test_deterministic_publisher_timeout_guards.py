"""Deterministic regression guard for subprocess timeouts in publisher adapters (Issue #260).

This is a REGRESSION GUARD — the bug is fixed.  These tests PASS and must
continue to pass.  A future refactor that removes timeout= arguments would break
these tests, giving early warning of the regression.

Bug was: GitHubPublisher and GitWorktreeSnapshot launched subprocesses without
explicit timeout= arguments.  A hung gh CLI call or a slow git worktree command
could block the pipeline indefinitely.

Fix (verified): Explicit timeouts were added to all subprocess.run() calls in
both adapters:
  - adapters/github_publisher.py line 45: timeout=30
  - adapters/repo_snapshot.py line 33: timeout=60 (checkout_ref)
  - adapters/repo_snapshot.py line 52: timeout=30 (cleanup worktree remove)

Parent bug: #226 / Epic: #146.
Status: PASSES — regression guard, not xfail.
