"""Deterministic source-inspection guard for plaintext secrets in settings (Issue #261).

Bug: Two sensitive fields are declared as plain str instead of Pydantic SecretStr,
     so their values are exposed in repr(), logs, and JSON serialisation.

Evidence:
  - webhook/config.py line 24: `secret: str`     — HMAC signing secret
  - config.py line 59:         `db_dsn: str`      — PostgreSQL connection string
                                                    (contains password in DSN)

Fix:
  - WebhookSettings.secret  → SecretStr
  - EedomSettings.db_dsn    → SecretStr
  Access via .get_secret_value() at the one site that actually needs the raw string.

Parent bug: #227 / Epic: #146.
Status: xfail — both fields are still plain str.
