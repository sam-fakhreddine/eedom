"""Regression guard for #206: SBOM base generation mutates the active checkout.

Bug (FIXED): agent/tool_helpers.py ran 'git checkout <base-sha>' directly in the
active repository to generate the base SBOM, then attempted to restore the prior
SHA in a finally block. This could disturb live checkouts and lose uncommitted state.

Fix: the helper now uses 'git worktree add' to create an isolated checkout so
the shared working directory is never touched during base SBOM generation.

These tests PASS while the fix is in place. They fail if someone reverts to the
in-place 'git checkout' pattern. See issues #206 and #240.
