"""Deterministic source-inspection guard for sequential plugin execution (Issue #254).

Bug: PluginRegistry.run_all() executes all plugins sequentially in a for-loop.
     Independent plugins — those with no declared depends_on relationship — are
     executed one after another, so a slow plugin blocks all subsequent ones.

Evidence:
  - registry.py line 156: `for plugin in plugins:` inside run_all()
  - registry.py line 180: `for plugin in plugins:` inside _run_all_per_package()
  - No ThreadPoolExecutor, asyncio.gather, or concurrent.futures anywhere in
    PluginRegistry's execution path.

Fix: Bucket independent plugins (after topological sort) and execute each bucket
     concurrently via ThreadPoolExecutor or asyncio.gather.  Plugins with
     depends_on constraints still execute in topological order.

Parent bug: #220 / Epic: #146.
Status: xfail — sequential execution still present in registry.py.
