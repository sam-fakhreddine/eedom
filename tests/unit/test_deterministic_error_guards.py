    Bug #179: The webhook server catches exceptions and includes them directly
    in user-facing responses (PR comments), potentially exposing internal stack
    traces and sensitive implementation details.

    Target (server.py:213-215):

    The `exc` object (when converted to string) may contain full stack traces
    depending on how the exception was raised. This gets posted as a PR comment,
    leaking internal implementation details to external users.

    Fix #179: Sanitize error messages before including in external responses.
    Use generic error messages for users, log detailed errors internally.
