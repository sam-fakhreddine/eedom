"""Deterministic guards for agent block mode — Issue #239 / Parent #205.

Bug: GatekeeperAgent block mode only fails if _decisions_have_reject is inferred
from response.value["decisions"]. If the LLM returns prose, skips a tool, or
returns a non-dict response, block mode exits successfully without a
deterministic decision payload — a security gate that can be bypassed by
LLM presentation behaviour.

These are xfail until block mode is driven by a typed pipeline decision that
exists independently of the LLM response shape. See issues #205 and #239.
