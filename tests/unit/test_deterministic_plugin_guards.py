    Detects when independent analyzers (no dependencies) execute sequentially.

    This is a deterministic guard for issue #254. Independent analyzers
    should be able to run in parallel, but the current implementation
    runs them sequentially in a simple for loop.

    The test creates 3 independent plugins (no depends_on) that each
    sleep for a fixed duration. If they run sequentially, total time
    will be ~3x the individual sleep time. If they run in parallel,
    total time will be closer to 1x the sleep time.

    Acceptance Criteria:
    - Test detects sequential execution pattern
    - Marked xfail until issue #254 is fixed
    - Uses strict=False to allow both xpass (bug present) and xfail (bug fixed)
