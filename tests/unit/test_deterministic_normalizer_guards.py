    Bug #209: The dedup key is (advisory_id, category, package_name, version)
    without severity. When findings with different severities are deduplicated,
    the order-dependent logic in lines 42-45 attempts to keep the highest
    severity, but the dedup key itself doesn't distinguish severities.

    Current code (normalizer.py:40):
        key = (f.advisory_id, f.category, f.package_name, f.version)

    This means the dedup dictionary treats findings with different severities
    as the same entry. While there's logic to prefer higher severity, the
    fundamental issue is that severity should be part of what makes a finding
    unique for proper deduplication.

    Fix #209: Add severity to the dedup key OR verify severity preservation
    works correctly in all edge cases.
