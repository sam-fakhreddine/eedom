"""Deterministic behavioral guard for seal completeness gap (Issue #264).

Bug: verify_seal() validates only the files listed in the seal manifest.  Any file
     added to the evidence directory after sealing is silently ignored, meaning
     an attacker can inject arbitrary artifacts into the evidence bundle without
     breaking verification.

Evidence:
  - seal.py lines 134-152: verify_seal() iterates over seal["artifacts"], checks
    those files, and then checks manifest_hash and seal_hash — but never compares
    the set of files currently on disk against the sealed artifact list.
  - tests/unit/test_seal.py line ~120 explicitly asserts that adding a new file
    does not break verification (documenting the current (buggy) behavior).

Fix: After checking all sealed artifacts, walk evidence_dir for any files not in
     the sealed artifact set (excluding seal.json itself).  If extra files are
     found, append an error per unexpected file so that valid is False.

Parent bug: #230 / Epic: #146.
Status: xfail — verify_seal() currently ignores extra files.
