    Bug #210: The webhook payload builder was including the full `results`
    list from ReviewResult, which contains complete PluginResult objects
    with all findings. This causes payload size blowup when there are many
    findings, potentially exceeding limits and causing memory/DoS issues.

    Current safe code (server.py:204-208):
        review_output = (

        - Any reference to result.results in the webhook handler
        - Serializing full ReviewResult to JSON
