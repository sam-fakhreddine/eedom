"""Deterministic guards for bootstrap wiring — Issue #238 / Parent #204.

Bug: The production bootstrap() wires _FakePackageIndex and _make_audit_sink /
_make_publisher unconditionally return NullAuditSink / NullPublisher regardless
of settings. Audit, publishing, and package metadata guarantees silently
disappear in the production composition path.

These are xfail until the bootstrap wires real adapters conditioned on settings.
See issues #204 and #238.
