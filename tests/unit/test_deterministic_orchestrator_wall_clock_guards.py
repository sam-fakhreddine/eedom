"""Deterministic guards for orchestrator wall-clock timeout — Issue #241 / Parent #207.

Bug: The orchestrator uses ThreadPoolExecutor as a context manager. When
as_completed() raises TimeoutError, the 'with' block __exit__ still waits for
all running futures before returning — so a slow scanner can hold CI past the
combined_scanner_timeout budget despite the TimeoutError being caught.

These are xfail until the executor shutdown is made explicit with
shutdown(wait=False, cancel_futures=True). See issues #207 and #241.
