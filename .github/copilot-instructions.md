# Eagle Eyed Dom — Copilot Context

This repo is a deterministic dependency and code review tool for CI. 16 scanner plugins, 900+ tests, zero LLM in the decision path.

## Architecture

Three-tier (cli → core → data). Imports flow downward only. Plugins auto-discover via `PluginRegistry`. All external calls have timeouts. Fail-open: no scanner failure blocks a build.

## Conventions

- Python 3.12+, structlog for logging, Pydantic models at boundaries
- Enums for all state fields, never raw strings
- Every source file has a `# tested-by:` annotation
- TDD red-green mandatory — test must fail before implementation
- Tests run in containers only (`make test`)
